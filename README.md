# Global-Alignment
## Introduction
A python implementation of the Needlemanâ€“Wunsch algorithm. This program will find the optimal global allignment of two DNA sequences.
## How to get the code
Type the following command into the terminal

`$ git clone https://github.com/Brandonag1997/Global-Alignment.git`
## Usage
The global allignment program takes 2 texts files containing either nucleotide or amino-acid sequences. To run navigate to ./Global-Alignment and make globalalign.py executable by running

`$ chmod +x globalalign.py`

The program takes at least 2 arguments, the locations of the sequences you want to align. Fow example

`$ ./globalalign.py ./examples/exampleSequence1.txt ./examples/exampleSequence2.txt`

This will output the best alignments for the 2 sequences and save the results to Output.txt
